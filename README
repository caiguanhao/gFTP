================================ gFTP ===================================

About
-----
gFTP is an FTP plugin for Geany on Linux.

Similar to NppFTP for Notepad++ on Windows.


Features
--------
 * FTP profiles.
 * Download -> Edit -> Save -> Upload.
 * SFTP/TLSv1/SSLv3 authentication.
 * Cache directory listings.
 * Index and search files.
 * Proxy profiles.
 * Import NppFTP/FileZilla profiles.


Usage
-----
You may need to add a profile first. Fill the basic info like hostname, 
username and password. You can leave the username and password blank, and 
it will prompt for them when you log in. Passwords are simply encrypted. 
If you care about your FTP account security, you can choose SFTP authentication 
(if your FTP server supports) or leave password blank. gFTP currently supports 
SFTP/TLSv1/SSLv3 authenticaiton. When you choose SFTP, you can specify where 
the private and public key located. gFTP doesn't understand and can't generate 
Putty's .ppk file right now. You can leave it blank to use default keys located 
in ~/.ssh folder.

When you connect to a FTP server, gFTP may navigate to the 'Remote' directory
for you. When you double click a file, it will be downloaded to a temporary 
folder (/tmp/gFTP/). For example, when you connect to ftp.mozilla.org anonymously 
and open the README file in the root folder, it will be downloaded to 
/tmp/gFTP/anonymous@ftp.mozilla.org/README and opened in Geany if Geany supports
reading this kind of file. If you specify the 'Local' directory, files will be 
downloaded to that directory.


Requirements
------------
 * libcurl4-openssl-dev 7.21+ (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
 * libgtk2.0-dev
 * libxml2-dev


Install (Ubuntu/Debian)
-----------------------
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian squeeze main"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gcc geany libgtk2.0-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev
$ cd src
$ sudo make && make install && make clean

Note: if you want to have multiple instances, re-run the last command:
$ sudo make && make install && make clean


Modify this plugin in Geany
---------------------------
 * Open gFTP.c in Geany and click Build > Set Build Commands.
   In C commands (Build), type 
   gcc -shared -Wall -fPIC -o "%e.so" "%f" `pkg-config libxml-2.0 --cflags --libs libcurl geany`
   
 * Set the Extra Plugin Path (Edit > Preference > General) to where the 
   new gFTP.so is built. To test, press F9 or click Build > Build.
   
 * Just run a new Geany instance to test it. To get more info, run
   'geany -v' in terminal instead. To debug, install gdb and run 'gdb geany'
   in terminal.


Test FTP locally
----------------
 * To test FTP or that with TLS/SSL authentication locally, use vsftpd.
   Here's a sample configuration for vsftpd:
   $ sudo mkdir /etc/vsftpd/
   $ cd /etc/vsftpd/
   $ sudo /usr/bin/openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout vsftpd.pem -out vsftpd.pem
   Then, you may need to provide information for the certificate. After that, 
   edit '/etc/vsftpd.conf':
   Uncomment several necessary lines, then append or modify these lines:
      ssl_enable=YES
      allow_anon_ssl=YES
      force_local_data_ssl=YES
      force_local_logins_ssl=YES
      ssl_tlsv1=YES
      ssl_sslv2=NO
      ssl_sslv3=NO
      rsa_cert_file=/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.pem
   If you want to set the port number, append this: listen_port=123 (e.g.).
   
 * To test SFTP, use OpenSSH.
